Simple Platforming Game - Geometry Jumper!

You're sitting on a platform, minding your own business. Dastardly shapes have begun to assault you, for reasons you can't quite comprehend. Avoid those accursed shapes! At least they move on one of two tracks.

One Button!
Spacebar - Jump

Three Shapes!
Squares - they angrily move at you along one track. They're not very smart.
Circles - they switch between both tracks repeatedly. Fake out!
Triangles - they act like a square...then they switch tracks halfway to try to fake you out. Still not very smart.
