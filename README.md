# Geom Jump
Geometry-Jumper is a game about jumping over shapes.

## Story
You're sitting on a platform, minding your own business. Dastardly shapes have begun to assault you, for reasons you can't quite comprehend. Avoid those accursed shapes! At least they move on one of two tracks.

## Controls
One Button!
Spacebar - Jump

## Shapes
Three Shapes!
* Squares - they angrily move at you along one track. They're not very smart.
* Circles - they switch between both tracks repeatedly. Fake out!
* Triangles - they act like a square...then they switch tracks halfway to try to fake you out. Still not very smart.
